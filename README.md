The first repository from the legendary ihross!

Greetings!

I'm brand new to programming but enjoy the learning process, and I hope others will help join me on my way.
Mostly I've been focusing on C++, as my (potential) main goal is to write code for modern video games.
Though I'm not entirely sure what the future will bring, I do look forward to the journey.
